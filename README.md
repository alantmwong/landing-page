# landing-page
Creating my first website with CSS from scratch. It has information about the Philadelphia 76ers, my favourite basketball team. 

A general colour palette and placement of titles, quotes, and layout have been inspired by a few pictures by the Odin Project. 

This web page is currently not optimised for mobile, and currently is only suitable for a desktop or tablet aspect ratio.
